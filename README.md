# Policy Analysis Tool

## Overview
This Policy Analysis Tool is designed to analyze public sentiment on government policies by fetching and analyzing comments from Reddit. It offers an interactive web interface for selecting policies, displays analyzed data, and generates downloadable PDF reports.

## Features
- **Interactive Selection of Government Policies**: Users can select from a pre-loaded list of government policies to analyze.
- **Automatic Data Fetching from Reddit**: Leverages Reddit's API to fetch relevant discussion threads and comments.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes a generative AI model to classify sentiments of the comments into positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Top Ideas & Concerns**: Also show the top ideas and top concerns given by public on selected policy. 
- **PDF Report Generation**: Summarizes the analysis results in a structured PDF report, which includes sentiment distribution and excerpts of comments.
- **Cached Data Display**: For select policies, displays previously analyzed and cached data for quicker access.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **PyWebIO**: Used for creating the interactive web interface.
- **PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)**: Facilitates the fetching of data from Reddit.
- **ReportLab**: Utilized for generating PDF reports.
- **Flask**: Serves as the backend framework to manage web interactions.
